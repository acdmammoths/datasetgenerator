History
-------
Once upon a time (possibly on July 22 1997), the IBM Almaden group published a
synthetic transactional dataset generator. The workings of the generator were
described in 'R. Agrawal and R. Srikant. Fast algorithms for mining association
rules in large databases. In Proc. 20th Int. Conf. Very Large Data Bases, VLDB
’94, pages 487–499, 1994'. The original version could be downloaded from
http://www.almaden.ibm.com/cs/quest/syndata.html (that page no longer exists).

After a while (around 2002-2003), the IBM version could not be compiled with
"modern" g++ compilers anymore. Paolo Palmerini (<paolo.palmerini@cnuce.cnr.it>)
published a g++-compilable modified version of the generator on his
[website](http://miles.cnuce.cnr.it/~palmeri/datam/DCI/datasets.php) (also no
longer existed). Paolo's modifications can be found in the source code by
looking for comments highlighted by "// g++".

As of June 2014 Paolo's version does not compile on current g++ (e.g., g++-4.9).
[Matteo Riondato](http://matteo.rionda.to) (<rionda@acm.org>) took up
the task to port the code to C++11 and make it compile with the current g++.
